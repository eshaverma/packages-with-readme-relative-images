So, in order to render SVG images that\nuse relative paths in markdown and have them render properly on NPM &amp; Yarn, you\nsimply have to append this query to your relative path: <code>?sanitize=true</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>Images have been updated to show the difference between unsanitized and\nsanitized (adding <code>?sanitize=true</code>) for svg images with relative &amp; absolute URLs\nserved from GitHub.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Chapter 1:</strong> Authoring</h2>\n<p>In GitHub-Flavoured Markdown (GFM), when you want to include an image using its\nrelative path you do either this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An <em>inlined</em> image:</p>\n<pre>![<span class=\"hljs-string\">description of the image</span>](<span class=\"hljs-link\">relative/path/to/image.ext</span>)</pre></blockquote>\n<p>or this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <em>referenced</em> image with a relative path:</p>\n<pre>![<span class=\"hljs-string\">description of the image</span>][<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">asset-1</span>]</pre><p>Where somewhere in the file (not sure if the order is a factor):</p>\n<pre>[<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">asset-1</span>]: <span class=\"hljs-link\">relative/path/to/image.ext</span></pre></blockquote>\n<p>Both GitHub and VSCode will resolve those paths relative to the markdown source\npath. So if you&apos;ve been down this path, you, myself included, might have\nconcluded that this is the behaviour to be expected when using relative paths\nin GFM.</p>\n<p>But then you try to figure out how to reference a particular branch or commit\nfor your assets, and things start going insane, and you might have decided to\ncut your losses just to keep things simple, as I did. Sparing details, you are\nessentially choosing between hard-linked githubusercontent or rawgit URLs which\ndon&apos;t fork or relative paths and maybe subtrees and those fork ugly but fork.</p>\n<p>So between relative and absolute, you would naturally opt for relative and you\nrepeat this to yourself a few times so that it sticks, before moving on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I promise to only use relative paths from now on!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Chapter 2:</strong> Publishing</h2>\n<p>Now you have your package all cooked up and ready to go and fire this:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">npm</span> publish</pre><p>or that:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">yarn publish</span></pre><p>Sweet, right&#x2026; not when you get something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you are awesome but does your package really work if you can&apos;t even get the\ndamn thing to render correctly on npm and yarn! <em>maybe you should stick to\nyour day job</em> and <strong>I will go ahead and use that other one that looks right</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that is what you will eventually be thinking that people are thinking when\nthey look at your broken README.md on both Yarn &amp; NPM (as of this moment),\nbecause not all images will render like this and we will see why in a bit.</p>\n<p>But you figure it has to be that relative paths are being resolved relative to\nyarnpkg.com or npm.com and that is an okay assumption, dead-wrong but okay, but\nhonestly, those guys do a lot of work trying to get your relative stuff to be\nas relative as if they were on GitHub&apos;s own rendering. Sadly, this last portion\ntakes a lot of investigating to appreciate, and like me, I think you just want\nto keep some of your remaining sanity rid yourself of relative paths and opt for\nabsolute paths (what could go wrong there aside from the obvious).</p>\n<p>So you if you opt to remain relativly sane-minded like myself most of the time,\nyou repeat this to yourself a few times, before moving on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I promise to only use absolute paths from now on!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Chapter 3:</strong> Republishing</h2>\n<p>Wow, it haz downloadz for a few days in a row, and you even start getting that\nawesome feeling when someone files their first issue:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>User:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is broken, and I hate you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>You:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love you so much, how can I make you happier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>User:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fix that shim or polyfill it up your stack</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>You:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I see. And how does that make you feel? Did you try this &#x2026;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>User:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother-bugger, people need to know that, here is a patch (aka pull-request).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>You:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I see, you are healing by helping others, I will follow that. Merged!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>User:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother-bugger, what happened to my figures?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>You:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother-bugger, I&apos;ve seen that before, let&apos;s stick to absolute paths (again).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you decide to learn from this, and you repeat this to yourself a few times,\nbefore moving on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I promise to only use text from now on, maybe html-served links, but my docs\nwill be as bland and possible and if anyone touches my assets I will have them\narrested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Reflection:</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Quick Comparison: </em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Relative SVG <em>fixed</em></th>\n<th>Relative PNG</th>\n<th>Absolute SVG <em>fixed</em></th>\n<th>Absolute PNG</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Referenced</em></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.svg?sanitize=true\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.png\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg?sanitize=true\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Inlined unsanitized</em></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.png\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Inlined sanitized</em></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.svg?sanitize=true\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"image.png\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg?sanitize=true\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some might say that the problem is that you are using SVG, but that would be a\nlittle embarrasing to say out loud!</p>\n<p>Some people may eventually hate that last bit and decide to do some mindfulness\nand reflection, and I happen to be one of those people.</p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown/blob/3cf46914cfc3a8b20847b3c190862239dbe0ba45/lib/plugin/github.js#L8-L13\">what npm does (aka marky-markdown)</a>:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> DEFAULT_REF = <span class=\"hljs-string\">&apos;HEAD&apos;</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">buildImageUrl</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">repository, url</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> prefix = <span class=\"hljs-string\">&apos;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&apos;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> prefix + path.join(repository.user, repository.repo, DEFAULT_REF, url.href)\n}</pre><p>Here is <a href=\"https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/blob/e155b85428e5ebed5eec9302a5179e47486dc07c/js/src/lib/Details/Markdown.js#L7-L42\">what yarn does (aka yarnpkg/website)</a>:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> GITHUB = {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">main</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&apos;https://github.com&apos;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">raw</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&apos;https://raw.githubusercontent.com&apos;</span>,\n};\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/* &#x2026; then &#x2026; */</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> { user, project, path, head } = githubRepo\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> prefix = <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">href, base</span>) =&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// prefixURL is a util function that does what it sounds like it does.</span>\n    prefixURL(href, { base, user, project, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">head</span>: head ?

You avoid this in\nproduction because GitHub is in the repo business, not a CDN.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>RawGit:</strong> if you accept the practical limitations on uptime that comes with\nthe fact that this is an awesome free service that doing it&apos;s best effort,\nyou can get properly MIME-typed files but to use them, you currently need\nabsolute URLs to work across the board (until it doesn&apos;t).</p>\n<p>There is magic in how RawGit, a true CDN service, helps you split-hairs when\ndeciding on the URL that best resolves to an asset across its history which\ncan also be <strong>permanently</strong> cached (as it should) for production when served\nfrom <code>cdn.rawgit.com/&#x2026;</code> versus <code>rawgit.com/&#x2026;</code>. Those are functionally two\nvery different services that cover most production and development scenarios.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>|                       |      SVG     |      PNG     |\n|:----------------------|:------------:|:------------:|\n| raw.githubusercontent <em>unsanitized</em> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg\">  | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\">  |\n| raw.githubusercontent <em>sanitized</em> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg?sanitize=true\">  | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\">  |\n| rawgit                | <img src=\"https://rawgit.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.svg\"> | <img src=\"https://rawgit.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/HEAD/image.png\"> |\n| cdn.rawgit            | <img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/636b6b8616eed31d6333ce98aa414ccd9a47b477/image.svg\"> | <img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/code-therapy/packages-with-readme-relative-images/636b6b8616eed31d6333ce98aa414ccd9a47b477/image.png\"> |\n|                       |              |              |</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just keep in mind that if you overtax them, you will be throttled or\neven banned (ie no more content served from repos under from your user or\norganization.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>You:</strong> Maybe file an issue, write a post, or pick absolute, or stick with\nrelative paths&#x2026; Nope, I just need a warm bath and maybe my next project will\nnot even require a README :)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"
